# -Vasicek-LIBOR-SONIA-Analysis
This project applies the Vasicek model to analyze LIBOR and SONIA rates (1997–2024), focusing on volatility, structural differences, and manipulation signals. It uses MLE for parameter estimation and RMSE for accuracy. The results underscore SONIA’s robustness as a risk-free benchmark compared to LIBOR. Includes MATLAB scripts and data.
